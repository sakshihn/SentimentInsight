## ✨ Features

- 📈 **Sentiment Classification** – Predicts positive, negative, or neutral sentiment from reviews  
- 🧠 **Explainable AI** – LIME and SHAP visualizations for transparent model interpretation  
- 🎨 **Rich Visualizations** – Word clouds, ROC curves, UMAP clustering, confusion matrices  
- 🗂 **Large Dataset Support** – Handles big CSV files (tested with 63MB+ IMDB dataset)  
- 📊 **End-to-End Jupyter Workflow** – From data loading to model evaluation in one notebook
